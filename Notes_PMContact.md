# Raw Ideas

* View all messages like an email inbox, collected by thread / tickets
* View all tickets like an email inbox

Tickets

* Tickets collect lots of messages to various contacts
* Tickets are a single idea
* Viewing a ticket shows communication grouped by each person

Ticket To Dos

* If a ticket gets new ideas, those can be split into a new ticket (OR...)
* If a ticket gets new ideas, we track those in the top like a ToDo list.  (can we tie tracking to each message)
* ToDo items are their own tickets?!  (probably too complex and too deep)
* Tickets could have predefined ToDo lists 
* Multiple ToDo lists for a ticket (like Trello)


# Defined Ideas

## Dashboard





## Tickets 
Tickets are actionable items that need to be tracked.

Questions

* Are tickets just like email threads?  
* Should a ticket be generated whenever a new message comes in?


## Messages
Messages are like emails.  They come in and are related to:

Displaying messages is similar to an email inbox.  Shows all messages coming in for this app. 

* Contacts (from and to)
* Tickets

Questions

* Can a message live without a ticket?



## Contacts 
Contacts are the users who send and receive messages

Contacts are tied to:

* Properties

## Properties
Will eventually get built out to a major part of the app.  This will include tons of data about a property that is missing from everything else.  It will tie into the ticketing system.


## HOA / Community Associations

* Association Name
* Contact Info - Primary Contact / Phone / Email  / Fax
* Management Company  - Primary Contact / Phone / Email  / Fax
* Address
* Subdivision
